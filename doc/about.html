<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

Eukaryotic cells range in size from 1 cubic micron to 1000 cubic micron. This wide range of sizes are captured by the Cell Volume property in PhysiCell. Cell volume is also important in modeling to capture the changes in cell size during different stages of cell cycle and cell death. For example, during necrosis, cell increase in size and bursts. While in apoptosis the cell loses cell volume over time. Similarly, during cell cycle, cell increases its size until it reaches a threshold and divided into two cells. In this application we have explored different properties of cell volume as well as parameters to control the cell
volume in PhysiCell modeling environment. 
Cell volume in Physicell is used to capture liquid and solid fractions in cytoplasm and cell nucleus.  
This also includes parameters to control biomass change rate in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Each cell has target value for these parameters and cells achieve that on given biomass change rate. 
</p>
<p>
In this app we have divided the data members of cell volume into two main categories Parameters and State Variables.
</p>
<p>
<b> Parameters: </b>
Parameters of the cell are those data member that define the volume of cell in its steady state. They also include  biomass change rates.
</p>
<p>
<b> State Variables: </b>
State Variables are used to store transitory values in cell. Cell will always try to go back to its steady state.
 In this app we have used a red circle that draws the steady state of cell according to its parameters. Even if you change
 the state variables and set them in an inconsistent value, the cell will reach its steady state sooner or later. 
</p>	</p>




<p>
<b> Method to adjust Cell Volume:</b>
If you want to change size of cells in your simulation but do not want to change each parameter individually then you can simply use the provided function to multiply every parameter by certain factor. This is the recommended way to change the volume of cells in any simulation.

    Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
    that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output files,
    they can be visualized in the "Out: Plots" tab. The "# cell frames" will be dynamically updated 
    as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
    that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<p>Modify parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot;, &quot;Microenvironment&quot;, &quot;User Params&quot;, tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the output results, click the &quot;Out: Plots&quot; tab, and move the slider bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;# cell frames&quot; field will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>If there are multiple substrates defined in the Microenvironment, you can select a different one from the drop-down widget in the Plots tab. You can also fix the colormap range of values.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice. And you can also generate an animation of the cells to play in the browser and, optionally, download as a video.</p>
